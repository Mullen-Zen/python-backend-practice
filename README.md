# Hello, Django!

This is nothing more than ongoing practice for me to teach myself the workings of a Django-based python backend for a web server, including some light (production/development-level) database stuff. It's based off the code found [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/tutorial-django). I'm continuously adding to it as I screw with features. Figured I'd make it public so that people would be able to see what I'm working on :P

*For production stuff there are two sections in settings.py that need to be modified*<br>
*They're pretty clearly marked via comments*
